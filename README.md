This is a project to present an intuitive visual tool that will improve the accessibility of the assessment data on Edmonton’s Open Data Portal.
A few years back when I was helping my parents to find a house, we stumbled upon Home Tribe’s info maps and found them really useful. However, they don’t seem to be making new maps, so I have decided to commit myself to this project. The reason to develop a new app is that I can't seem to be able to find a free service that I could use to achieve my goal, as the services I tried didn’t seem to be capable of doing calculations on the fly. Hopefully, this app can help other people with their projects.
