# Ymap

This is a project to present an intuitive visual tool that will improve the accessibility of the assessment data on Edmonton’s Open Data Portal. 

A few years back when I was helping my parents find a house, we stumbled upon Home Tribe’s info maps and found them really useful. However, they don’t seem to be making new maps, so I have decided to commit myself to this project.
